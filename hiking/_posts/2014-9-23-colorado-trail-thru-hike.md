When I was planning my 2014 Colorado Trail thru-hike, I looked for books from other people who had done it. I don't mean a guidebook or anything like that. I wanted to read a memoirs-style book. I wanted to read about the experiences that someone had while hiking the whole trail. What was hard and what was easy? Where did he screw up? What was the most unexpected thing to happen? What was just as he expected? What food did he continue to crave? Who were the most interesting people he met? That's the kind of book I was looking for.

As it turned out, there weren't any. This came as a surprise to me, because these books exist by the drove for the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail. These books can be extremely useful in setting expectations for aspiring thru-hikers, and there simply weren't any for the Colorado Trail.

Well fear no more, because [I wrote a memoirs-style book of my 2014 Colorado Trail thru-hike](http://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Rockies-Thru-Hike-Colorado-Trail-ebook/dp/B00NRLDKGA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1411419732&sr=1-1&keywords=colorado+trail+thru+hike). It's currently only available for Kindle, but if you don't own a Kindle that's no problem! There are Kindle apps for every computer, smartphone, and tablet out there. If you're reading this sentence then you can read a Kindle book.

My thru-hike was somewhat unique since I moved at 25+ miles per day. It'll be especially interesting to anyone who is looking to hike the trail faster than average. It's a great read for *anyone* looking to hike the Colorado Trail though.

The hike was not without its ups and downs. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that there were some major setbacks. I talk about injuries, my mistakes (oh there were so many to talk about), the cool (and whacky) characters I met, sickness, food (I talked a lot about food), my gear, and much more. There were triumphs and there were tribulations, and through it all I learned more than I ever thought I would.
