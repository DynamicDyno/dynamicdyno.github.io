I'm a front end developer living in Boulder, CO. I work for [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com). I make beautiful and blazingly fast websites.

I like to travel, rock climb, hike, snowboard, and learn languages.

I spend a lot of time thinking about all of the things that I want to accomplish in life. You can check out [my bucket list](/my-bucket-list/) to see what I find important.

You can look at all of the code for this website in [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DynamicDyno/dynamicdyno.github.io). Feel free to fork and do as you please.
