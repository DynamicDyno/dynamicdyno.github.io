I'm a front end developer living in Boulder, CO. I work for [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com). I make beautiful and blazingly fast websites.

I like to travel, rock climb, hike, snowboard, and learn languages.

I spend a lot of time thinking about all of the things that I want to accomplish in life. You can check out [my bucketlist](/my-bucketlist/) to see what I find important.
