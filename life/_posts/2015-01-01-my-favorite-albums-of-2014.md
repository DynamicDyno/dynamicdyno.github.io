This is a list of my top ten albums of 2015. They aren't necessarily the most original, but they were the ones I enjoyed the most.

### 10. The Rosebuds - Sand + Silence

It's like, modern motown?

### 9. Death From Above 1979 - The Physical World

It's unbelievable what two guys with a bass and drums can do.

### 8. Flight Facilities - Down to Earth

Down to Earth is an extremely varied, yet remarkably cohesive record.

### 7. Cymbals Eat Guitars - Lose

The straight up rock 'n roll album I needed.

## 6. Wildcat! Wildcat! - No Moon At All

I had been waiting for this album for over a year, when I saw them open for Alt-J and was blown away. They put on a more entertaining set than the headliner everyone was there to see. The entire place was dancing. The singer paused in between songs and said, "Thanks for dancing so much everyone. We know none of you have even heard of us before, so that's really cool."

Their debut album didn't disappoint either.

## 5. Angus & Julia Stone - Angus & Julia Stone

Super chill singer songwriter folk by a brother/sister duo.

## 4. Bombay Bicycle Club - So Long, See You Tomorrow

This album is more pop than their previous albums--a welcome change for me!

## 3. The Colourist - The Colourist

This is the epitome of what I look for in indie pop. Catchy, dancey, fun.

## 2. Withered Hand - New Gods

How can you not love a singer songwriter with a voice like this?

## 1. Kishi Bashi - Lighght

I'll tell you this--Kishi Bashi is an expert at crafting a pop song about a steak who just loves to dance. I know--impressive.
